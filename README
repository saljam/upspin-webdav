Upspin-webdav serves the upspin name space over WebDAV to localhost.

Some caveats:

- On macOS Big Sur arm64 the kernel panics on renames. Amd64
  and iOS don't seem to have this problem.

- On Windows it looks like one has to edit some registry keys
  to allow it to connect to a non-https server even on localhost,
  but I could have just been holding it wrong.

It's certainly no replacement for FUSE+upspinfs. Still, WebDAV might
be useful when one cannot load kernel modules for FUSE, or in order
to sync files with devices that only support WebDAV.
